~~Retrieve a list of all courses from http://www.ime.ntnu.no/api/course/-~~

Create a database from the retrieved data
 - update database once a week
 - write tests for database creating, insertion, deletion and updating

Implement search interface to search for courses both by course name and code
 - display list of relevant results
 - when user clicks on a search result, display that course

Let user save courses so they don't need to be retrieved every time

Provide links to course page on classmate.no
